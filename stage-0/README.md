# Creating a data structure to organize information
The Stage 0 task of the HackBio February 2025 internship entails the creation of a data structure of our choice that includes the following information about ourselves: 
* Names
* Slack usernames
* E-mail addresses
* Hobbies
* Countries
* Disciplines
* Preferred programming languages

Upon deliberation, we thought it is wise to use the **data.frame()** structure to complete the task. We chose this, because data frames can hold different types of data inside them (i.e.,character, logical, numeric). 
We were working with character variables and we wanted to present the data in a table format.

The code includes the creation of a simple data frame, followed by printing the output.
