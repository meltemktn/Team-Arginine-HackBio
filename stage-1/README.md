# Functions Galore! 
The Stage 1 task of the HackBio February 2025 internship involves writing four different functions for specific purposes, two of them being related to each other:


**Function 1 : Translation of DNA into protein**
  
This function takes a DNA sequence as input. It slices the sequence into sub-strings of 3 (codons) and appends them to an empty character vector defined within the function. A dataframe of all the codons and their corresponding amino acids is also defined within the same function, where codons encoding the same amino acid are given as vectors within a list. Next, each codon within the DNA sequence is replaced with its corresponding amino acid by traversing the column of list of codons in the dataframe. Once a stop codon is reached, the function stops and returns the final amino acid sequence.




**Function 4: Calculating the Hamming distance between a Slack username and a Twitter/X username**

Hamming distance is a metric that yields the number of substitutions required between strings of equal length (For more information see (Hamming.
