# Drug Discovery Project

The Stage 3 project of the [HackBio](https://thehackbio.com) February 2025 internship involves the analysis of a [chemical descriptor matrix](https://github.com/HackBio-Internship/2025_project_collection/raw/refs/heads/main/Python/Dataset/drug_class_struct.txt) with over 10000 compounds docked against adenosine deaminase (ADA2), an enzyme involved in purine metabolism and is essential for the development and maintenance of the immune system in humans. Increased levels of ADA2 are associated with many diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and sarcoidosis.

Using the information given in the dataset, we attempted to answer the questions below:

- How similar are these molecules to each other?
- Can we effectively predict the docking score using the chemical features of ligands alone?
